Based on the analysis of search results from DuckDuckGo and Google over 100 queries, we observe that the average percent overlap between the two search engines is 13.2%. This indicates that, on average, only a small fraction of the top search results are common between the two engines, suggesting significant differences in the way they prioritize and rank content. The average Spearman rank correlation coefficient across all queries is -5.11, which is highly negative and suggests an inverse or uncorrelated ranking relationship. A negative Spearman coefficient implies that when results do overlap, their rankings are often inconsistent between the two engines. This highlights that DuckDuckGo and Google use substantially different ranking algorithms, leading to varied result placements even when they retrieve some of the same webpages.
