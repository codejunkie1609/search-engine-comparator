Web Search Engine Comparison
This repository contains an assignment focused on comparing search results from Google with another search engine. The objective is to analyze how closely their rankings match by issuing a set of queries and evaluating the differences.

To measure the similarity between the rankings, we use the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient, which quantifies the statistical dependence between the rankings provided by the two search engines.

Key Components:
Query execution on assigned search engines.
Collection and ranking of search results.
Computation of the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient to determine ranking similarity.
Analysis and documentation of findings.
